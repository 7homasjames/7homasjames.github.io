<h2>RESEARCH</h2>
<p>
    My research interests lie at the intersection of Explainable AI, Bayesian Optimization, and Multi-Objective Optimization.  
    I focus on developing AI models that are not only efficient but also transparent and interpretable,  
    ensuring that decision-making processes are clear, justifiable, and actionable.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My work integrates optimization techniques, information theory, and probabilistic modeling  
    to enhance AI explainability and performance.  
    I am particularly interested in leveraging counterfactual reasoning and uncertainty quantification  
    to improve model interpretability and robustness in real-world applications.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    My current research focuses on developing novel algorithms for scalable Bayesian Optimization,  
    incorporating multi-objective and entropy-based search strategies.  
    These methods aim to improve hyperparameter tuning, model selection, and trust-region optimization  
    for complex AI systems.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ultimately, my goal is to bridge the gap between theory and application,  
    ensuring that advanced optimization and explainability techniques translate into real-world AI systems  
    that drive innovation and meaningful decision-making.
